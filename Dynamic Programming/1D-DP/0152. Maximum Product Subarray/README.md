## 📋 Problem Description
**Problem Number**: 152  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**LeetCode Link**: [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)  
**Pattern**: Dynamic Programming / Kadane's Algorithm

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

## 💡 Implementation Strategies

### 1. Brute Force ($O(N^2)$)
Check every possible subarray `(i, j)` and calculate its product.
* **Logic**: Use a nested loop where the outer loop marks the start and the inner loop calculates the product to the end.
* **Drawback**: Inefficient for large arrays; recalculates products repeatedly.

### 2. Optimized DP ($O(N)$)
We maintain both a `maxProduct` and a `minProduct` ending at the current position. 



* **The Swap Trick**: When we encounter a negative number, the `maxProduct` becomes a very small number and the `minProduct` (if negative) becomes a very large number. We **swap** them before multiplying to keep the tracking accurate.
* **Decisions**: At each element, we decide to either start a new subarray (`x`) or extend the existing one (`x * maxProd`).
